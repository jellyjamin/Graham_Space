Python is the swiss army knife of the coding world, being simple to use and its libraries giving developer thousands of tools in their field. 

### Data scientists 

- Libraries such as Numpy and Pandas make data analysis a breeze while Tensorflow and Scikit allows anyone to dabble in machine learning.


### Web developers

- With the Flask, FastAPI, or Django web developers can build backends that are secure and easy to put together.


### Cybersecurity 

- Python allows Cybersecurity professionals to automate their tasks, whether its to detect virus's or do automated scans.


### How I use it?

- I use it for all my automation tasks, in my [daily spin ups](https://graham-space.pages.dev/p/my-daily-spin-ups-as-a-self-hoster/) article I give my personal remote backup/encryption script built in python.
