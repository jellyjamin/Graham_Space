## What is Python and How is it Used?

Python is the Swiss Army knife of the coding world, being simple to use and its libraries giving developers thousands of tools in their field.

### Data Scientists
- Libraries such as NumPy and Pandas make data analysis a breeze while TensorFlow and Scikit-learn allow anyone to dabble in machine learning.

### Web Developers
- With Flask, FastAPI, or Django web developers can build backends that are secure and easy to put together.

### Cybersecurity
- Python allows cybersecurity professionals to automate their tasks, whether it's to detect viruses or do automated scans.

### How I Use It?
- I use it for all my automation tasks. In my [daily spin ups](https://graham-space.pages.dev/p/my-daily-spin-ups-as-a-self-hoster/) article I give my personal remote backup/encryption script built in Python.

## How to Install Python?

### Windows
Simply head over to the [Python download section](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the Python installer. Make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation.

### Linux
Linux installation is as easy as using this single line of commands:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3
```

### macOS
On macOS, you can install Python using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install python3
```
