This is where I found myself two years ago when looking for how to simply download my music playlist from Youtube, which at the time as a broke college student was demanding the same amount as my prime subscription and yet I would have my custom mixes of my favorite songs deleted anyways. 

I found [Yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) in a reddit post, which I learned not only did what I wanted (download videos but whole playlists) but how I wanted it to except one part....be as hands off as Youtube premium.
