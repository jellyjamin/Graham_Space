## [Openrouter](https://openrouter.ai/) an LLM chat API aggregator, [announced](https://openrouter.ai/announcements/1-million-free-byok-requests-per-month) that they have opened up 1 million free BYOK (bring your own keys) requests per month. 

This slashes their standard platform fee of 5%, allowing users to still use their all in one API but get billed through their Openai or anthropic accounts. This is perfect for those of us who have lingering balances spread across developer accounts and a good excuse to make your switch.
